# Awesome Social Distancing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Collection of awesome resources, tools, and initiatives to alleviate loneliness, isolation, and other burdens imposed by "social distancing" measures.

[Social distancing](https://istayhome-info.now.sh/) is a strategy used to slow or contain a contagious infection. When imposed by public health officials, the public is urged to reduce or eliminate physical contact with other people. This list offers pointers to digital tools, services, or platforms that can be used in lieu of physical contact to maintain social, economic, and other connections with other people during such times.

For context, during the [(COVID-19) coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), many people started asking for our recommendations of digital tools to support their community's emotional and mental health. Isolation, loneliness, and lack of intimate contact can dramatically reduce the quality of life for already vulnerable populations. With stress levels high, and public officials warning of extended periods of [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) measures necessary for many months to come, we decided to compile a list of digital platforms that you might be able to use to augment your social interactions to stay as healthy and happy as possible throughout the crisis.

**Please contribute** as you are able by [posting a new issue on our issue tracker](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/awesome-social-distancing/issues/new).

We also urge you to consider supporting efforts to provide relief from the impacts of this situation and simultaneously improve conditions for all people by taking measures to, for example:

* **End reliance on health insurance for access to medical care.** This pandemic is a perfect showcase why a medical system built for-profit is a dangerous detriment to the health of everyone, including insured people.
* **End reliance on employment for healthcare and income.** Suspend all employment obligations and provide free healthcare, sick leave, and food (stamps/SNAP/universal basic income) for all.
* **End rent, erase all debt.** Immediately stop enforcing parking violations, evictions, and other property-protecting activities that diminish the health and wellbeing of the population at large.
* **Release all humans held captive in cages.** Release all prisoners from confinement in the unsanitary and dangerous conditions of jailhouses and all the other cages they are being held captive inside of and provide for housing instead.
* **House the houseless.** Convert unused spaces such as empty lots and now-empty, city-owned buildings into shelter for those without alternative housing options.

We make little distinction between these categories for now other than doing our best to evaluate the primary intended purpose of the application from the software creator's perspective.
